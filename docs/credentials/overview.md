# Overview

LaaS aims to provide a service that is easy to integrate, fast but safe and secure. We use the app token as a mandatory credential so that you can quickly integrate the service with your website without having to build any server to use it.

Tokens will be automatically generated when you register to use our service.

For security, we combine the use of your application's token and your website's domain to perform authentication and enable the integration of our services.
